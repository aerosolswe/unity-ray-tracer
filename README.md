# unity-ray-tracer

This is a very bad and unoptimized ray tracer in Unity. I was experimenting with ray marching in Godot and wanted to try to make a ray tracer aswell but this time I wanted to do it in Unity..

To make this ray tracer I followed the famous "Ray Tracing in One Weekend"  and "GPU Ray Tracing in Unity"
